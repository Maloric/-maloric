# Maloric

I'll probably come to regret the dumb project name later, but for now this is a dumping ground for a couple of different Typescript / JavaScript projects that I want to maintain out in the open:

-   Testility - a few useful testing tools that are mostly framework agnostic, except for the DummyComponent for Angular.
-   Flyonic - a handful of useful components that help me keep my Ionic apps DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

If you think any of this stuff is remotely useful, feel free to use it, modify it or redistribute, as long as you obey the MIT license. If you do not, the MIT Gremlins will find you.

And if you are having trouble sleeping at night, go read my blog at www.medium.com/@maloric. I also Tweet from time to time under my nom de plume: @Maloric85.

Ciao!
